Guess the Number Game
Overview
"Guess the Number" is a simple web-based game where you try to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100. You have a limited number of attempts to find the correct number. If you guess incorrectly, you'll be told whether your guess is too high or too low. The game tracks the number of attempts and displays a message when you guess correctly or reach the attempt limit.

How to Play
A random number between 1 and 100 is generated by the game.

Type your guess into the input field and click the "Guess" button.

If your guess is too high or too low, you'll get a hint.

After each guess, the game will display whether the guess was correct or not.

You have a maximum of 10 attempts to guess the correct number.

If you reach the 10th attempt without guessing correctly, the correct number will be revealed.
